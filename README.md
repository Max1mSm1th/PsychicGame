# PsychicGame


FUNCTION // 

The purpose of this assignment was to construct a "Psychic Game" using recently learned JavaScript skills. The goal of the game is to guess which letter the computer (your opponent) is guessing. Each round has 8 attempts for the users. A score is tabulated by wins and losses. 


USEFULNESS //

Although the game itself isn't high-level, the concepts and code structure used to develop the game can be applied to many other array-based programs. This game utilizes functions, if statements, arrays, key events, randomization, and various other processes to piece together a functional game. 


NEXT STEPS //

I plan on taking the concepts learned developing this game and applying it to a more complex game such as hang-man-style game.
